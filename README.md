## Introduction
A hot topic in Data Science is how to teach it. This repository presents the content of a 20-hour course on Deep Learning at USP - Universidade de São Paulo, the best university in Latin America. The course aimed to provide an introduction to Deep Learning, covering essential topics, and offering hands-on experience using PyTorch, the main framework in academia.

### Course Goals
The course was designed for students with prior knowledge of Python programming, particularly with Numpy arrays, and a basic understanding of linear algebra and probability. The main topics covered were:

- **Fundamentals**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Geometric Deep Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Large Language Models**

Each session lasted 4 hours, consisting of theoretical instruction (1h45), a coffee break (30 minutes), and hands-on activities (1h45).

### Detailed Course Outline
The following is a breakdown of the macro-areas and sub-topics covered, along with the hands-on exercises associated with each:

#### **Fundamentals**
- Machine Learning basics, Multi-Layer Perceptron, Gradient Descent, Hyper-parameters, Representation learning.
- **Hands-on:** MLP Classification.

#### **Computer Vision**
- Image data structure, Convolutional Operations, Filters, Auto-Encoder, Latent Space, Fine Tuning.
- **Hands-on:** Implementing an Auto-Encoder.

#### **Geometric Deep Learning**
- Graph Basics, Message Passing Algorithm, Graph Convolutional Layer, Self-Attention, Node & Graph classification.
- **Hands-on:** Document classification.

#### **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Background, Tokens, TF-IDF, Embeddings, Word2Vec, CBOW, Skip Gram, BERT.
- **Hands-on:** Sentiment Analysis.

#### **Large Language Models (LLM)**
- Tokens, Embeddings, RNN and LSTM, Self-Attention, Auto-encoder, Sentence transformers, LLMs Architecture, training LLMs.
- **Hands-on:** Vector Databases.
